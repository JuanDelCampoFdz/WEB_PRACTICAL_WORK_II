        <h1>Final College Proyect</h1>
        <h2>How did this idea came up?</h2>
        <p>During my time at university, I have been part of a program called "College." During this time, we have frequently visited a foundation in Arganzuela called Altius. At this organization, I met a middle-aged Colombian woman named Sonia. She shared with me the severe human rights violations she was facing. For example, business owners take advantage of her illegal status to offer her jobs with extremely low wages, which, based on the hours worked, is considered labor exploitation. As a result, Sonia felt forced to accept the job in order to contribute to her family's economy. When she shared this story with me, I began to think about how we could address situations like this and create a more inclusive Spain.</p>
        <h2>Resolution Proposal</h2>
        <p>The proposal is for a functional website, currently in the prototype phase in Figma, aimed at immigrants (like the users of Altius). The website includes all the essential information and resources that immigrants need to know and have access to, instead of having to figure out where to find things like food or how to access legal help in a country theyâ€™ve just arrived in. This website includes places where food can be found, such as foundations, NGOs, or food distribution centers. Additionally, it includes sections on housing, legal advice (including phone numbers for lawyers willing to work on cases of social injustice for free), and even second-hand clothing collection centers.</p>
        <h2>Other features</h2>
        <p>Furthermore, the website also features a job board. Similar to other platforms like Infojobs, where job positions are posted and job seekers can apply, the job board we propose aims to give immigrants the opportunity to appear as users seeking employment so that companies can learn about them and hire them. The job profiles will include the person's full name, training courses completed, place of residence, availability, and so on. This will encourage companies to hire workers from other countries, as hiring people seeking to improve their living conditions is also a way of contributing to societal benefits, which helps companies build a positive image of inclusion. This contributes to corporate social responsibility, and in addition, it benefits immigrants who will receive a job opportunity in return.</p>
