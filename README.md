## Actions

- Created and organized all the files and folders i am going to work with.
- Made a handmade prototype of how my web page is going to look like.
- Created a nav bar that includes all the differents pages I want my web page to have.
- Added the links to connect each page.
- Created in the Index file a section that briefly explains my website.

- Includes sections for program purpose, structure and future subjects.
- Finally in my FCE section I covered the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject and provided links to the presentations.


## Problems during the development

- I struggled with the paths, it was hard to discover what I needed to add .. at the start to get the path correctly. Finally understood it and I had no problems afterwards. 
- Image display: It was really hard to position the images where they belonged because they did not attached correctly to the css file due to an error in the code
- CSS not applying was also really difficult because other pages would overlap and mess up my page.

## Conclusion
- The project was really fun and challenging, I learned advanced concepts in html code. Although at some points it was stressful and didn't manage to get things correctly I am really satisfied with the final product. I'm looking forward to more programming in my future subjects and I really enjoyed the journey.
